# Text Analysis with Bible and Quran

This project involves the analysis of text data from the Bible and Quran using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goals include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and other exploratory analyses.

Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, spacy, gensim)
You can install the necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn spacy gensim

Data
The text data for the Bible and Quran is provided as CSV's inside of this repo. 

Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was performed on both Bible and Quran texts using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The sentiment scores were visualized using pie charts.

python
Copy code
# Code snippet for sentiment analysis
King James corpus available in repo
Quran corupis avaialble in repo

# Perform sentiment analysis
bible_sentiments = perform_sentiment_analysis(bible_text)
quran_sentiments = perform_sentiment_analysis(quran_text)

# Visualize sentiment analysis results
visualize_sentiment_analysis(bible_sentiments, "Bible Sentiment Analysis")
visualize_sentiment_analysis(quran_sentiments, "Quran Sentiment Analysis")
Topic Modeling
Topic modeling was conducted on each sentence of both texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The resulting topics were printed and visualized using bar plots.

python
Copy code
# Code snippet for topic modeling
# (Assuming you have loaded the Bible and Quran texts into 'bible_text' and 'quran_text' lists)

# Preprocess texts for LDA
bible_lda_texts = [preprocess_lda(sentence) for sentence in bible_text]
quran_lda_texts = [preprocess_lda(sentence) for sentence in quran_text]

# Train LDA models
bible_lda_model = train_lda_model(bible_lda_texts, num_topics=5)
quran_lda_model = train_lda_model(quran_lda_texts, num_topics=5)

# Visualize LDA topics
visualize_lda_topics(bible_lda_model, "Bible Topic Distributions")
visualize_lda_topics(quran_lda_model, "Quran Topic Distributions")
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named entities were extracted from the texts using spaCy. The distribution of named entity labels was visualized using bar plots.

python
Copy code
# Code snippet for named entity recognition
# (Assuming you have loaded the Bible and Quran texts into 'bible_text' and 'quran_text' lists)

# Extract named entities
bible_entities = extract_entities(bible_text)
quran_entities = extract_entities(quran_text)

# Visualize named entity distribution
visualize_named_entities(bible_entities, "Bible Named Entity Distribution")
visualize_named_entities(quran_entities, "Quran Named Entity Distribution")
TF-IDF Analysis
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis was conducted to calculate the weight of the word "love" in each text relative to the rest of the text.

python
Copy code
# Code snippet for TF-IDF analysis
# (Assuming you have loaded the Bible and Quran texts into 'bible_text' and 'quran_text' lists)

# Perform TF-IDF analysis
bible_love_tfidf = calculate_love_tfidf(bible_text)
quran_love_tfidf = calculate_love_tfidf(quran_text)

# Visualize TF-IDF analysis
visualize_love_tfidf(bible_love_tfidf, "Bible Love TF-IDF Analysis")
visualize_love_tfidf(quran_love_tfidf, "Quran Love TF-IDF Analysis")
Visualizations
All visualizations, including pie charts, bar plots, and other figures, are available in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

Conclusion
The sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and TF-IDF analyses provide valuable insights into the textual content of the Bible and Quran. Key findings and patterns are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook.
